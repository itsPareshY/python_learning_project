# Python Learning Plan

## 1. Running Current Code:
- **Objective:** Ensure that your current Flask application and tests are running correctly.
- **Actions:**
  - Run the Flask application using `python src/main.py`.
  - Execute the tests with `python -m unittest tests/test_main.py`.

## 2. Python Basics and Automation:
- **Objective:** Understand Python syntax and basic programming concepts.
- **Topics:**
  - Variables, data types, and control structures (similar to Java).
  - Functions and modules.
  - File handling for automation tasks (reading/writing files).
- **Resources:**
  - Online tutorials or courses on Python basics.

## 3. Web Development with Flask:
- **Objective:** Build web applications using Flask.
- **Topics:**
  - Setting up routes and handling requests (similar to servlets in Java).
  - Creating HTML templates and serving dynamic content.
  - Working with forms and user input.
- **Project Idea:** Create a simple web app that automates a task (e.g., a to-do list).

## 4. Using Python Libraries for Automation:
- **Objective:** Learn to use libraries for various automation tasks.
- **Libraries:**
  - `requests` for making HTTP requests.
  - `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping.
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Project Idea:** Automate data retrieval from a website and process it using `pandas`.

## 5. Generative AI with Python:
- **Objective:** Understand how to use AI libraries in Python.
- **Libraries:**
  - `transformers` for working with NLP models.
  - `OpenAI API` for integrating generative AI features.
- **Project Idea:** Create a chatbot or text generator using a pre-trained model.

## 6. Deployment and Availability:
- **Objective:** Learn how to deploy your applications.
- **Topics:**
  - Using platforms like Heroku or AWS for deployment.
  - Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- **Resources:** Documentation for Heroku or AWS services.

## 7. Additional Learning Topics:
   - **Project Setup:** Instructions on how to set up the project environment and dependencies.
   - **Coding:** Basic to advanced Python coding concepts.
   - **Libraries:** Overview of commonly used libraries in Python.
   - **Debugging:** Techniques and tools for debugging Python applications.
   - **Deployment:** Steps to deploy your Python application to production.
   - **Environments:** Understanding virtual environments and their importance in Python projects.

## Current Progress

- Completed running `main.py` and tests successfully.
- Learned about Python basics, including:
  - File handling with `open()`, `read()`, and `readlines()`.
  - String formatting using f-strings (e.g., `f"..."` and `f'''...'''`).

### Next Steps
- Start from the next topic in the learning plan related to Python basics and automation.

## Instructions for Future Reference:
- After covering each topic, strike it from this file to keep track of progress.
- This file serves as a self-sufficient context for future sessions.
