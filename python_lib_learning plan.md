    "NumPy",  # Core library for numerical operations, foundation for many scientific libraries.
    "Requests",  # Simple and widely used for making HTTP requests.
    "Flask",  # A lightweight web framework that’s beginner-friendly.
    "FastAPI", # FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on Starlette (for async web server handling) and Pydantic (for data validation and serialization). It is designed to be fast, easy to use, and production-ready.
    "Django",  # Popular web framework, though slightly steeper than Flask, but still essential.
    "Matplotlib",  # Commonly used for basic data visualization.
    "Seaborn",  # Built on top of Matplotlib, simplifies complex data visualizations.
    "python-docx",  # Commonly used for creating and editing Word documents programmatically.
    "csv",  # Built-in, simple, and widely used for working with CSV files.
    "json",  # Built-in, essential for handling JSON data.
    "sqlite3",  # Built-in library for lightweight database handling.
    "PyPDF2",  # Popular for working with PDFs (merging, extracting text, etc.).
    "Pytest",  # Widely used testing framework for Python. Highly useful for maintaining code quality.
    #"xlrd",  # Essential for reading old Excel files.
    #"xlwt",  # For writing to old Excel files.
    "openpyxl",  # Used to read/write Excel 2010+ (.xlsx) files. Common in data work.
    "BeautifulSoup",  # Commonly used for web scraping. Easy to learn and apply.

    "Pillow",  # Essential for basic image processing tasks.
    "Selenium",  # Great for automating browsers and web scraping.
    "reportlab",  # For generating PDFs programmatically. Less common but highly useful.
    "SQLAlchemy",  # Powerful ORM for working with databases, widely used in larger apps.
    "Keras",  # Beginner-friendly deep learning library, useful for machine learning.
    "TensorFlow",  # Powerful for deep learning, but with a steeper learning curve than Keras.
    "Scikit-learn",  # Very popular for traditional machine learning algorithms.
    "PyTorch",  # Popular deep learning framework, often considered more flexible than TensorFlow.
    "transformers",  # Popular for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, rapidly growing in importance.
    "langchain",  # A newer library for building language model-based applications. Growing in importance, but not as essential as others.
    "Openai",  # Used for interacting with OpenAI’s models, very useful but more niche for general Python work.
